Chrisâ€™s Dynamic Compressor plugin for Audacity

This is Chris Capel's Dynamic Compressor plugin for Audacity. After the death of the author, with his father's permission, Daniel J. Lewis has been hosting this plugin at http://theaudacitytopodcast.com/chriss-dynamic-compressor-plugin-for-audacity/ .

I have taken this code and changed the default values to better work for voice audio. I thought it was a good idea to give this code a chance to be better known, an occasion to be improved by others, and I decided to publish it here.


I will try to contact the relevant people to notify them of the existence of this repository. If decided, the repository will be deleted.
